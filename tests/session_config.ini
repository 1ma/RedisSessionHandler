; This is the phpredis session handler. It is not actually used during the tests because
; visit-counter.php overwrites it with a call to 'session_set_save_handler', but if that
; call is commented out then the phpredis session handler is the one that gets tested.
session.save_handler = redis

; Inside any of the testing containers 'redis' resolves to the IP of the Redis container.
